# Before running it, raise the version in Cargo.toml ([workspace.package], as x.y.z) and commit
# everything. Then this:
#   1. builds kaye.exe and the .msi with build-installer.ps1, which also checks nothing private
#      is in them
#   2. pushes main, and makes the GitHub release v<version> from that commit, with kaye.exe for
#      the updater and the .msi for new installs
#   3. writes latest.json with each file's size, SHA-256 and link, then commits and pushes it
#
# latest.json goes last, so nobody is offered an update whose files aren't up yet. If an upload
# fails, the half-made release is deleted again. It signs in to GitHub the way git push does,
# through Git Credential Manager, so run git push once first if it has never asked.
#
# The files an update is made of are listed in $shipped below. Kaye is one exe today. A file
# added there reaches everyone's install on their next update, and one taken out is deleted
# from installs that got it from an update.
